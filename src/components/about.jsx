        <h1>About me</h1>
        <p> Hi there! I'm Patrick Star, a friendly and easygoing starfish living under the sea in the charming town of Bikini Bottom.
             My home is a cozy rock where I enjoy relaxing and napping. I'm best friends with SpongeBob SquarePants, and we have lots of fun adventures together.
            I'm known for my laid-back attitude and simple outlook on life. I love jellyfishing, eating Krabby Patties, and hanging out with my friends.
            While I might not be the brightest star in the sky, I always try to help out and make people laugh with my goofy antics. 
            Life's better when you're just being yourself, and that's exactly what I do every day!
